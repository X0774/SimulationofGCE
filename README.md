# Problem:
Read ref. [2112.09699] carefully and try to grasp the main message.
- Reproduce some results about the total GCE flux in sec. 2.2. Notably, fig. 3 results for Calore et al 2015.
- Focus on sec. 4, and on the total number of MSPs, N_GCE
  * Consider the 3 benchmarks luminosity functions: AIC [42], disk [41] and GLC [34], and reproduce fig. 7
  * Reproduce N_GCE for the 3 benchmarks reported in Tab. 1
