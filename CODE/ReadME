Here you can see my codes; the ROOT macro is not actually meant to be used as a macro, but it just contains the commands I used from the ROOT console.

The mathematica file contains mostly everything that is not directly a Fit (initially I also fitted the spectrum using Mathematica to get initial values for ROOT's Fit Parameters, but since I had to specifically fit Calore 2015 the best idea was to use the values given by Calore 2015!)
